# Wrapper for processing RNAseq data

This is a wrapper for some commonly used programs for processing RNAseq data. I wrote it since it made my pipelines 
more reproducible while keeping things completely modular and also allowing for any other program to be added. 
The main thing I like is that there is consistent log files output and the direct path to a program can be passed 
(I've found this useful on shared servers.)

Please feel free to add/contribute or use.
